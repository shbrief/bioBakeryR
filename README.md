## bioBakeryR

[bioBakery workflows](https://github.com/biobakery/biobakery_workflows) is a collection
of workflows and tasks for executing common microbial community analyses using standardized,
validated tools and parameters. bioBakery is built and maintained by [Huttenhower lab](http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/).

For R users with limited computing resources, we introduce bioBakeryR workflow
package. This package allows users to run 'Whole Metagenome Shotgun (wmgx) workflow
version 3' on Google Cloud without writing any workflow, installing softwares, nor
managing cloud resources. The computing resource is managed by [Terra](https://app.terra.bio/#),
a cloud-based genomics platform, and users only need to setup their account only
once at the beginning to use bioBakeryR.
