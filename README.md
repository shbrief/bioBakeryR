## biobakeR

[bioBakery workflows](https://github.com/biobakery/biobakery_workflows) is a collection
of workflows and tasks for executing common microbial community analyses using standardized,
validated tools and parameters. bioBakery is built and maintained by [Huttenhower lab](http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/).

For R users with limited computing resources, we introduce biobakeR workflow package. 
This package allows users to run **Whole Metagenome Shotgun (wmgx) workflow version 3** 
on Google Cloud without writing any workflow, installing softwares, nor managing cloud 
resources. The computing resource is managed by [Terra](https://app.terra.bio/#),
a cloud-based genomics platform, and users only need to setup their account only
once at the beginning to use biobakeR.

You can find out how to use this package [here](https://rpubs.com/shbrief/RunTerrraWorkflow_bioBakery).
